# Student Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application that presents student quizzes and announcements data for the current semester. It is built using **React + Redux + TypeScript** for the frontend, and **Express.js + MongoDB** for the backend.

## Features
- Login/logout functionality (no username or password required)
- Dashboard rendered only for logged-in users
- Higher Order Component (`requireAuth`) to protect routes
- Responsive design suitable for all screen sizes
- Reusable components using **Material UI** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Sidebar links change background and foreground color on hover
- Prepared for future translation using the i10n concept
- Full CRUD operations for announcements and quizzes
- Simple animations added using **GSAP**
- Using **RTK Query** for clean code and strong system to handle API calls
- Clean and well-structured code following best practices

## Notes
- **Testing:** API endpoints were tested manually using **Postman**. Automated tests were not implemented as I am not familiar with testing in React/Node yet. All features have been manually verified to work as expected.
- All code was written manually; no boilerplate generators were used for the core functionality.
